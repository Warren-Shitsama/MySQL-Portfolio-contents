üìä MySQL Projects
Welcome to my repository dedicated to various MySQL database projects! This collection showcases my work with relational databases, focusing on database design, SQL querying, optimization, and practical applications of MySQL.

üöÄ Overview
This repository serves as a portfolio of my MySQL projects, ranging from simple database schemas to more complex applications involving advanced SQL functionalities. Each project is designed to demonstrate different aspects of MySQL, including:

Database Design: ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) creation, normalization, and schema definition.

SQL Queries: Complex SELECT statements, JOIN operations, subqueries, and aggregate functions.

Data Manipulation: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations.

Stored Procedures & Functions: Reusable code blocks for efficient data processing.

Triggers & Events: Automating database tasks and maintaining data integrity.

Indexing & Optimization: Strategies for improving query performance.

üìÅ Project Structure
Each project typically resides in its own dedicated folder. Inside each project folder, you'll generally find:

Schema.sql: SQL script(s) for creating the database, tables, and defining relationships.

Data.sql: SQL script(s) for populating the database with sample data.

Queries.sql: A collection of SQL queries demonstrating various functionalities or solving specific problems related to the project.

project_name.md or README.md: A project-specific README detailing its purpose, design choices, and how to run it.

er_diagram.png/drawio: Visual representation of the database schema.
